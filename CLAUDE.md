# token.app

AI model pricing tracker and comparison tool built on Cloudflare Workers with Hono. Data sourced from OpenRouter API. Deployed at https://token.app (custom domain) and https://token-app.measurable.workers.dev.

## Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Framework**: Hono
- **Storage**: Cloudflare KV (`TOKEN_APP_KV`)
- **Data**: OpenRouter `/api/v1/models` (JSON) + `/rankings` (RSC payload scraping)
- **Secrets**: `REFRESH_SECRET` via `wrangler secret put`

## Key files
- `src/index.ts` — Hono routes (API + SSR page)
- `src/template.ts` — Full HTML/CSS/JS template (SSR, single-file SPA)
- `src/fetchers.ts` — OpenRouter data fetching, normalization, KV read/write
- `src/subscriptions.ts` — Static subscription plan data
- `src/types.ts` — All TypeScript interfaces
- `src/providers.ts` — Provider metadata (colors, display names)

## Dev
- `npx wrangler dev --port 8799` — local dev server
- `npx wrangler deploy` — deploy to production
- Cron runs hourly (`0 * * * *`) to refresh model + rankings data
- Manual refresh: `POST /api/refresh` with `Authorization: Bearer <REFRESH_SECRET>`
- `wrangler.toml` is gitignored (contains KV namespace IDs)

## Gotchas
- **OpenRouter /rankings is JS-rendered now**: the SSR HTML no longer contains ranking data (turbopack Next.js app). `fetchRankingsFromOpenRouter()` uses the Cloudflare Browser Rendering binding via `@cloudflare/puppeteer`. Stable selector: `[data-testid="model-rankings-leaderboard-row"]` for models; Top Apps section has no testid (fallback to innerText regex). Requires `[browser]` binding in `wrangler.toml` and Workers Paid plan.
- **OpenRouter /rankings has NO period toggle**: the "This Week" / "Today" buttons in the new UI are model-search comboboxes, not period selectors. Models are fixed at 7-day rolling; apps are today-only. Don't try to click them to switch periods — won't work and silently produces duplicate data. To support UI 24H/7D/30D toggle, we accumulate hourly snapshots in D1 and aggregate over windows ourselves.
- **D1 rankings history**: append-only `rankings_snapshots` table (`migrations/0001_*.sql`). Cron writes ~30 rows/hour. Read paths: `readLatestModels(env, 'week')` for any UI period (models don't change with toggle); `readLatestApps(env)` for day, `aggregateApps(env, days)` for week/month. Aggregation takes LAST snapshot per identifier per day then SUMs across days.
- **Week/month aggregations are gated behind real history**: `getRankings(env, 'week'|'month')` calls `countAppDaysInRange()` first and returns `topApps[period]=[]` plus `appsHistoryDays/appsHistoryRequired` when fewer than N distinct calendar days of snapshots exist. Without this gate, a 1-day SUM gets labelled "7D" and looks identical to 24H — the "fake rankings" bug from 2026-05-28. Client (`emptyAppsMessage()` in `template.ts`) renders "X/Y days of history collected" so users see why the panel is empty. Real data lights up automatically as snapshots accumulate.
- **Empty-overwrite guard**: `refreshAllData` refuses to record a snapshot when scraping yields 0 models AND 0 apps. Stops silent cache poisoning if OpenRouter's UI changes again — keeps last-good D1 data and surfaces `rankingsError` instead.
- **`[]` is truthy in JS**: `appsData.week || appsData.day` returns the empty `.week` array, not `.day`. The rankings UI fallback checks `byPeriod.length > 0` instead. Worth remembering for any future period-keyed shape.
- **Template literal escaping**: Model descriptions can contain backticks and `${` — use `safeLiteral()` before embedding in template.ts.
- **`\'` is invalid in JS template literals**: backslash is silently ignored for single quotes. Use `this.hidden=true` instead of `this.style.display='none'` in inline handlers.
- **`/api/refresh` can't run the long category scrape**: HTTP `ctx.waitUntil()` is cancelled ~30s after the response (Cloudflare limit); only the *scheduled* (cron) handler has the 15-min budget for the ~2-3 min category scrape. `refreshAllData(env, { includeCategories })` gates it — cron passes `true`, `/api/refresh` awaits the fast path (models+rankings+market-share, ~45-60s, under the ~100s edge timeout) and leaves categories to the cron. Backgrounding a long job after a 202 silently truncates — don't.
- **Market-share legend: extract by CONTENT, not tag**: the `#market-share` rows are NOT reliably `<button>`-wrapped (OpenRouter changed the DOM; the spike's `<button>` assumption broke extraction → empty for 2 days). Walk up from each `a[href="/{author}"]` to the nearest ancestor whose text has a `%`, anchored on the link label. Reject non-author links (clean-slug regex + denylist) — the section holds a `/models?fmt=cards` CTA next to the unnamed "Others" aggregate. Sanitize on read too (`isAuthorSlug` in `readMarketShare`). Also: `page.waitForFunction(string)` THROWS under `@cloudflare/puppeteer` — poll with `page.evaluate(string)` instead.

## Current Work
- **Last updated**: 2026-06-26 — **Phase D (UI) SHIPPED + merged to `main`** (prod version `f8ae7410`). Rankings has the market-share area chart + category tabs; codex review cleared. **Phases A–D complete.**
- **State**: on `main` at `4991fc4` (FF-merged `feature/rankings-phase-d-ui`, pushed to origin). Prod redeployed from `main` → `f8ae7410`. Origin branch `feature/rankings-phase-d-ui` still exists (delete when ready; both commits are on `main`).
- **Shipped this session**: `areaChartSvg`/`authorColor`/`marketShareLegend` (hand-rolled inline SVG, no chart lib); "Token Share by Model Author" section (history-gated, 30D/90D toggle, lazy-loaded on first Rankings open); category tabs using `data-rankcat` (avoids the global `[data-cat]` handler on the API-model tabs) with `&category=` threaded into `buildRankingsUrl` + per-period cache invalidation.
- **Deviations from plan (intentional)**: `data-rankcat` not `data-cat` (collision); lazy-load wired via the main-tab click handler since `init()` server-seeds rankings and never calls `loadRankingsPeriod`. Plus a subject-verb grammar fix in the empty-state copy.
- **Verified live** (token.app, cache-busted): `/api/market-share?window=30` → `historyDays:3`, 9 authors → **chart renders**. `/api/rankings/categories` → 11 cats. `?category=cli-agent` board OK. Failure-state + legend-latest-day code live. Verification: tsc + `node --check` + real-browser pass (esbuild-render + static-serve + `fetch` monkeypatch; local wrangler can't run dev — see toolchain note).
- **Toolchain gotcha (FIXED this session)**: local `node_modules` was corrupted → every `wrangler` cmd crashed with `Class extends value undefined` (miniflare) on BOTH Node 22.14 and 24 → blocked dev server AND deploy. Fix: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`. A `node@24` brew keg was installed mid-debug but is **unnecessary** (`brew uninstall node@24` to drop it). Preview-without-wrangler recipe in claude-mem `tokenapp-local-preview-workaround`.
- **Codex review**: PASS (no P1); 2 P2s fixed in `4991fc4` — market-share shows a retry message on fetch error (was stuck "Loading…"); legend % derives from the union's latest day so it agrees with the chart when an author drops out. **Optional cleanup**: `brew uninstall node@24` (feature branch already deleted).
- **NEXT TASK — remove the `/usage` + `/keyring` pages** (decided 2026-06-26; unused). Delete: `/usage` route (`index.ts:785`) + `src/usage-template.ts`; `/keyring` route (`index.ts:183`) + `src/keyring-template.ts`; nav links (`template.ts:1417-1418`), hero-announce (`:1451-1453`), footer links (`:1675`); sitemap `/usage` (`index.ts:689`); llms.txt "Usage Dashboard" (`index.ts:531`). **PRESERVE** all "usage rankings"/"Token Usage Leaderboard" copy — that's the Rankings feature, not the page. **DECIDE FIRST**: also drop the agent-facing `/registry.json` + `/mcp` + `/.well-known/mcp` + `/llms.txt` (they use `buildRegistry` from `packages/keyring/`, branded "BYOK keyring registry") and whether to delete `packages/keyring/` (client = dead npm item; registry still powers those endpoints)?
- **Backlog**: keyring-npm / `/usage` / keyring-v2 items DROPPED. Later: rankings v2 (category-board sparklines/deltas + category-aware models once category history accumulates). Skip: benchmark overlays, receipt import.
- **Op note — REFRESH_SECRET**: ROTATED 2026-06-24 (old value dead). Set via `wrangler secret put REFRESH_SECRET`; NEVER commit the value.
